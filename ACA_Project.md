# Cyber Security ACA Project

***Mentor-Nikhil*** ***Vanjani***

Our project was aimed at Understanding various Network Technologies, Learning and implementing PHP , Basics of cryptography, Knowing about various types of network attacks and implementing them in DVWA.

The project progressed in 4 phases:
- Network Technologies:
    - Done half of the NPTEL course on Network Technologies.
    - Learnt about layering in Networks.
    - Network and Routing Protocols.
    - HTML, XML, CGI Scripts.
- Learning PHP:
    - Done a course on PHP and mySQL from Lynda.
    - Made a Content Management System named as WidgetCorp using basic PHP and mySQL. In this, an authorised user can modify its content while an unauthorised user can only view its content. [Code Link](https://github.com/vibcode/Widget-Corp)
- Familiarised with Network Attacks:
    - We learned about various attacks like DDos and top 10 OWASP attacks.
    - Implemented some of them on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).
- Familiarisation with Cryptography:
    - Understood basics of cryptography.
    - Understood RSA algorithm- RSA is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. There are two different keys.One is Public key which is visible to everyone other one is Private key. It utilises concepts from Number Theory. It is based on the fact that finding the factors of an integer is hard (the factoring problem).
